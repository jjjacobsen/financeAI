Using AI to calculate a budget and give financial advice based on my current financial state, primarilly written in Go

- The main benefit is for when I calculate my net worth every month and I sort my transactions into categories like gas, groceries, drinks, etc
    - Use AI to do the sorting
- Can access my transaction history through apis, and make sure not to let any kind of passwords end up on the public repo
- Can also access my loan information and other assets through apis
- Have this code put everything into the google sheet so I can see it easily
- Once I have all this data, use AI to calculate a budget and give financial advice
